Request Process of TADA Basic; Business Review
=======

This post is for deprocessing a Request Process of TADA Basic.  
It is one of *my personal study*, focusing on **how successfully User needs/problems are met/solved through the prodcut**.  
Especially I am interested in **discovering the underlying logics** of all deciesions made at the production. So please note that the prodcution here is not equals to developmental concept.

## PURPOSE of Business Review  
  
**It is to discover a purpose of the prodcut.** It's obvious that we must know why we're dealing with the product before prouction starts. 
It consists of two perspectives: Problem solving and Making a profit.  

**Problem Solving** - Let's say that business is to solve some problems(needs) people have. 
Then there would be one or more 'main missions' each company has - problems they try to solve by business. 
Prodcucts might focusing on all missions or only part of them. In this perspecitve, the unique problems(needs) of the prodcut should be clearly defined.
In that way, we can trace the hidden logics. 

**Making a profit** - Every business cannot survive if there isn't enough profit. So key success factors of the business would affect several decision makings.
This perspective requires unpacking the business structure - how they earn moeny and what is the main cost to reuce. 
Eventually, it must be reinterpreted in terms of the prodcuction. *Is their any integral points to be considered?*  
On the other hand, there might be some priority based on a stage of the business or project. It can also affect the decision-making criteria
  
## MISSION of TADA (Basic)
TADA wants to improve the daily transportaion experience. So it seems that concrete inconvenience each product defines might be very important here. Let's see how it assigned missions on its prodcuts.  
Although I guess 'transportation' here is literally every transportaiton vehicles, so far they've launched six services satisfying several needs.
